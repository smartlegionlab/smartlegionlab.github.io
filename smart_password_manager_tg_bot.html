        Generate smart passwords on the fly. Your passwords are not stored anywhere,
        but you can still store the names and public keys to manage and retrieve your smart passwords.
        When creating a password, after entering a secret phrase, it is automatically deleted from the chat.
        After generating a password, you can copy it.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        It will also be automatically deleted from the chat in a few seconds.
        Even if someone gains access to your device, they will not be able to see your secret phrases in the chat with the bot, as well as your passwords.
        The password can only be obtained by entering a secret phrase.

        In turn, your secret phrases and passwords are not stored on the server either.
        The bot only stores the names, public key and length.
        Neither we nor anyone else will ever know your secret phrases for accessing passwords,
        nor the passwords themselves, since they are not stored anywhere, but are generated on the fly.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        Even if an attacker gains access to our server, he will not be able to access your passwords,
        but will only see the names, public keys and length of the passwords.
        This information will not help him generate your passwords, since to generate them,
        he needs a secret phrase that is stored in the most secure place - in your head.
